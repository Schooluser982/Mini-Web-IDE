# Key Features of the Mini Web IDE
1. Integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Editor
All three core web languages live side‑by‑side.

Users can write markup, style it, and script interactions in one place.

Great for quick prototyping or experimenting with ideas.

2. Live Preview Environment
Code updates can be rendered instantly, giving users immediate feedback.

Helps beginners understand how each language affects the final output.

3. Save & Load Functionality
Users can store their projects and return to them later.

Makes the IDE feel more like a real development environment rather than a temporary sandbox.

Encourages longer, more complex projects.

4. Built‑In Dev Tools (Beta)
Early-stage debugging tools give users insight into what their code is doing.

Even in beta, this adds a layer of professionalism and utility.

Shows you’re thinking beyond just editing—toward a full development workflow.

5. Built Entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
No frameworks or heavy libraries required.

Lightweight, portable, and easy to host anywhere.

Demonstrates your understanding of the fundamentals and your ability to build tools from scratch.
